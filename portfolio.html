        <h2> My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>I am currently taking a Physical Computing course having to do with Arduino Uno and this is the most interesting class I have taken in city tech so far, it has to do with physical things and as well as coding. For the final project I had to come up with a physical thing that has working components on it so a user can interact with this. </p>

        <h2>My Final project</h2>
        <p>
            This is the final result I have created with the requirements given to me. This is a push button game where you have two fingers on the top of the box and two other fingers on the side, once the button is pressed the one below the light, will turn off then the next one will turn one. The next light is chosen completely randomly. Only one light will be on at a time and you can only press the button below it in order for it to be turned off.
        </p>
